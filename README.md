# FINALProject_FaceRec

Our project - ProTecht is a face recognition security system for rooms. The setup includes a camera for face recognition, automated door lock (motor for prototype model) and PIR sensors inside the room that will sense any unrecognized / unauthorized motion in the room. In addition, protecht also has a mobile application for all users to track any authorized / unauthorized entries with alert messages sent whenever an unauthorized entry is sensed.
